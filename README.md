The app could be called "MediQuiz" and would consist of two main sections: a general medical knowledge section and individual course sections.

The general medical knowledge section would include questions from all the major medical courses, including anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, microbiology, and pathology. These questions would be designed to test a user's overall knowledge of medicine and would cover a wide range of topics.

The individual course sections would be designed to help users study for specific medical courses. For example, there could be a section for anatomy questions, a section for physiology questions, and so on. These sections would include questions that are specific to the course and would be designed to help users prepare for exams.

The app could also include a feature that allows users to track their progress over time. Users could create an account and save their quiz scores to see how they're improving over time. They could also set goals for themselves and track their progress toward those goals.

To make the app more engaging and motivating, it could include a leaderboard where users can see how they rank compared to other users. The leaderboard could be divided by course section, so users could see how they rank specifically in anatomy, physiology, etc.

Overall, MediQuiz would be a comprehensive medical quiz app that would be useful for students and professionals in the medical field. It would help users test their knowledge, study for exams, and track their progress over time.
